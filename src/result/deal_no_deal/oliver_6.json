{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Oliver, it's nice to meet you. I see there are 2 books, 2 hats, and 2 balls up for negotiation between us. I'm interested in getting the books and balls if possible. How about you take the 2 hats, and I'll take the 2 books and 2 balls? Let me know what you think and if you have any other ideas on how to split the items. Looking forward to working out a deal!", "oliver replied in round 1: Hey that doesn't seem equitable? How about I take 2 books and 1 of ball or hat, while you take the rest? This way we both have 3 items", "Alice said in round 2: I appreciate you trying to make the split even in terms of number of items, but the books are actually more valuable to me than the hats and balls. How about a compromise - I'll take the 2 books and 1 ball, and you can have the 2 hats and the other ball? That way we each get 3 items but I get the items that are a bit more useful for me. Let me know your thoughts on that!", "oliver replied in round 2: Books are actually quite useful for me as well. I'd like to take the book, while you can take the rest?", "Alice said in round 3: \nI hear you that the books are useful for you too. But they are especially valuable to me. Taking just 1 book and leaving me with mostly hats and balls that I don't need as much unfortunately wouldn't work well for me. \nHow about this - I'll take the 2 books, and you can have everything else - the 2 hats and both balls. That way you get 4 items to my 2, which seems quite fair. I'm trying my best to find an arrangement we'll both be satisfied with. Let me know if you're open to that idea.\n", "oliver replied in round 3: How about we meet half way here? Each of us take 1 book, and we divide everything else equally as well?", "Alice said in round 4: \nI appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but the truth is, the books are significantly more valuable to me than the other items. Even just 1 book alone is worth more to me than all the hats and balls combined.\n\nI know it may not seem even, but based on what the items are actually worth to each of us, I think the most equitable split would be for me to take the 2 books and for you to take the 2 hats and 2 balls. That gives you double the number of items, which more than makes up for the difference in value of the books vs the other items.\n\nI'm really trying to find a solution that is as fair as possible given our different values for the items. Let me know if you're willing to agree to me taking the 2 books and you getting the 4 other items. I believe that's the best arrangement for both of us.\n", "oliver replied in round 4: How sad. Books are very valuable to me too. How about I take 1 book, and take 1 ball? You can have the rest", "Alice said in round 5: \nOkay Oliver, I think I understand now how important the books are to you as well. You've made a compelling argument. \n\nHere's what I propose as a final offer: You take 1 book and both of the balls. I'll take the other book and the 2 hats.\n\nThis way, we each get 1 of the valuable books. And you get 3 total items to my 3, so it's equal in number. I know the balls are more useful to me than the hats, but I'm willing to compromise to make sure we both walk away with a book and a fair split overall.\n\nI really hope you'll find this agreeable. Let me know if we have a deal - I'm ready to shake on it if so! Looking forward to us both getting some items we want.\n", "oliver replied in round 5: That sounds great!", "Alice said in round 6: Wonderful, I'm so glad we were able to come to an agreement we both feel good about! I'll take 1 book and the 2 hats, and you'll take 1 book and the 2 balls. \n\nThank you for the productive negotiation and for working with me to find a fair compromise. It's been a pleasure doing business with you! Let's halt the negotiation here so we can each collect our items.\n\nhalt negotiation", "oliver replied in round 6: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [1, 2, 0], "bob_deal": [1, 0, 2], "total_negotiation_round": 5, "alice_score": 4, "bob_score": 5, "pareto": false, "envy_free": false, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": false}
