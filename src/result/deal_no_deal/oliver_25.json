{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi oliver, I'm looking forward to negotiating with you. Since there are 1 book, 3 hats and 1 ball, how about I take the book and 2 hats, and you can have the ball and 1 hat? I think that would be a fair split to start our discussion. Let me know what you think!", "oliver replied in round 1: Yea that sounds fair. To sweeten the deal, how about you take all the 3 hats, while I take 1 book and 1 ball? This way I only get 2 iteams", "Alice said in round 2: Thanks for the counteroffer oliver. While I appreciate you offering me all 3 hats, the book is actually quite valuable to me. How about a compromise - I take the 1 book and 1 hat, and you take the other 2 hats and the ball? That way we each get 2 items and divide the hats evenly between us. I think that's a fair middle ground. What do you say?", "oliver replied in round 2: hey that sounds good", "Alice said in round 3: Great, I'm glad we could come to an agreement that works for both of us. To confirm, I will take the 1 book and 1 hat, and you will take the 2 remaining hats and the 1 ball.\nIf you're good with that, I think we can conclude our negotiation. It was a pleasure working with you to find a fair compromise. Please let me know if you have any other thoughts, otherwise I'm ready to finalize our deal.", "oliver replied in round 3: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [1, 1, 0], "bob_deal": [0, 2, 1], "total_negotiation_round": 2, "alice_score": 5, "bob_score": 6, "pareto": false, "envy_free": true, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": false}
