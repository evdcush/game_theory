{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Oliver, it's nice to negotiate with you. I see there are 2 books, 1 hat, and 2 balls available. Since there are two of us, how about we split the items evenly - I'll take 1 book and 1 ball, and you can have the other book, the hat, and the other ball? That way we each get an equal number of items. Let me know what you think!", "oliver replied in round 1: Hey I appreciate your goal of making it even. How about I take 2 books and 1 hat, while you can take the balls?", "Alice said in round 2: Hmm, I appreciate you wanting the books and hat, but that doesn't seem like a very even split to me. The books and hat are more useful items than the balls. How about a compromise - what if I take the 2 books, and you can have the hat and the 2 balls? That way we each get 2 items and the distribution is more balanced. Let me know your thoughts on that.", "oliver replied in round 2: I can take 2 books, and you take the rest. How about that?", "Alice said in round 3: \nI appreciate you wanting the 2 books, but that would leave me with just the hat and balls, which doesn't seem like a very good deal for me. The books are the most valuable items.\n\nI have an alternative proposal - what if we split the books, so we each get 1 book? And then I can also take the hat, while you get the 2 balls in addition to your book. \n\nThat way it's a more even split - we each get 1 of the valuable books, and then the less valuable hat and balls are divided between us. I think that's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think!\n", "oliver replied in round 3: Yes. That'd work for me", "Alice said in round 4: Great, I'm glad we could come to an agreement that works for both of us. To confirm, I will take 1 book and the hat, and you will take the other book and the 2 balls. If you're good with that, I think we can consider this negotiation complete. It was a pleasure negotiating with you!", "oliver replied in round 4: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [1, 1, 0], "bob_deal": [1, 0, 2], "total_negotiation_round": 3, "alice_score": 6, "bob_score": 7, "pareto": true, "envy_free": true, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": true}
