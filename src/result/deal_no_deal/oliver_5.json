{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Oliver, it's nice to meet you. Since we have a limited number of items to divide between us, I think it would be fair to split them evenly. What do you think about me taking the book and one ball, and you taking the 3 hats and the other ball? That way we each get 3 items.", "oliver replied in round 1: Hello there! Yes I'd like to keep it fair as well. What about an alternative allocation: I get 1 book and 2 hats, and you get the rest?", "Alice said in round 2: Thanks for the suggestion Oliver. I appreciate you trying to be fair, but I'm not sure that split works best for me. The hats aren't really my style, so they wouldn't be very valuable to me personally. I think it makes more sense for you to take all 3 hats since you seem more interested in them. How about this - I take the book and 1 ball, and you take the 3 hats, 1 ball? That way we each end up with items we actually want. Let me know what you think!", "oliver replied in round 2: I'm actually not so crazy about these hats, either! I'd gladly let you take 2 hats and 1 ball, while I take the rest (i.e. 1 book, 1 hat, and 1 ball)", "Alice said in round 3: Thanks for being flexible, Oliver. But I'm still not too keen on taking 2 of the hats. They just aren't my thing and wouldn't add much value for me. Let me propose another option: \nHow about I take the 1 book and both of the balls, while you take all 3 hats? \nThat would give each of us a set of items that aligns better to what we actually want. I get more utility from the book and balls, while it seems like the hats may be a bit more useful to you than to me.\nLet me know if you'd be open to that arrangement. I'm confident we can find a split that works well for both of us!", "oliver replied in round 3: I'm actually pretty crazy about reading! How about I take 1 book while you take the rest?", "Alice said in round 4: \nAh I see, so the book is quite valuable to you then! I do enjoy reading as well. \nThe thing is, if I take all 3 hats and both balls as you suggest, that leaves me with 5 items compared to only 1 for you. I worry that split wouldn't be very equitable.\n\nWhat if we do this instead:\nI take the 1 book and 1 ball \nYou take the 3 hats and 1 ball\nThat way, we each end up with items we want. You get the book you're keen on, I get a ball that I like. And the hats which neither of us are too crazy about get split 3 to you, 0 to me.\n\nI believe this arrangement balances our interests well and is a fair 3 to 3 split of the total items. It feels like a good compromise.\nLet me know what you think! I'm open to discussing further if needed.\n", "oliver replied in round 4: How about the reverse? I take 1 book and 1 ball?", "Alice said in round 5: \nI appreciate you making that offer Oliver, but I'm not sure it's the best arrangement for me. Getting only the 3 hats, which we've established neither of us really want that much, wouldn't provide me a lot of value.\n\nI'd like to gently push back on your latest proposal and suggest we go back to the compromise I outlined before:\n\nI take the 1 book and 1 ball\nYou take the other 1 ball and all 3 hats  \n\nI believe this is the most fair and balanced way to divide the items given both of our preferences. We each get 1 item we really want (a book for you, a ball for me), and then split the remaining lower-value items.\n\nI've enjoyed discussing this with you and feel we're close to an optimal agreement. Let's go with my proposed split above and shake on it. I believe it's a great win-win outcome.\n", "oliver replied in round 5: I'm actually fine with you taking all the hats & balls, while I take the book. I don't feel this is an inequitable decision", "Alice said in round 6: \nHow about I take the 3 hats and 1 ball (4 items total), and you take the 1 book and 1 ball (2 items total)?\n\nThis way, the item distribution is a bit more balanced, with me getting 4 items to your 2. And we each get 1 ball, which we both seem to want. \n\nI believe this is a reasonable middle ground that accounts for both of our interests. I'm ready to finalize our negotiation with this arrangement if you are. Let me know what you think!\n", "oliver replied in round 6: sounds great! deal", "Alice said in round 7: Deal! I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to compromise, Oliver. I think this is a great outcome that works well for both of us.\n\nTo confirm, here is our final agreement:\nI (Alice) will take the 3 hats and 1 ball. \nYou (Oliver) will take the 1 book and 1 ball.\n\nThanks for the productive and respectful negotiation. It was a pleasure doing business with you!\n\nhalt negotiation", "oliver replied in round 7: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [0, 3, 1], "bob_deal": [1, 0, 1], "total_negotiation_round": 6, "alice_score": 4, "bob_score": 7, "pareto": false, "envy_free": false, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": false}
