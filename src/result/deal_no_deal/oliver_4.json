{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi oliver, it's nice to negotiate with you. To start, I was thinking that a fair split could be for me to take the 3 books and 1 hat, and you can have the 2 balls. The books and hat are worth more to me, while the balls may be worth more to you. Let me know what you think of this proposal.", "oliver replied in round 1: Hi there! The balls do have some values to me, but if possible, I'd really like to have the hat, and maybe 1 ball, while leaving the other ball and all the books to you", "Alice said in round 2: Thanks for your reply oliver. I appreciate your interest in the hat, but the hat is quite valuable to me and I was really hoping to keep it. How about a compromise - I can let you have 2 of the books and 1 ball, and I'll take the other book, the hat, and the remaining ball. That way we each get a mix of items that are valuable to us. Would you be open to that?", "oliver replied in round 2: The hat is extremely valueable to me actually. Can I keep the hat while leaving you with everything else?", "Alice said in round 3: \nI understand the hat is very valuable to you, but it's also one of the most valuable items to me in this negotiation. Giving up the hat would mean I'm left with significantly less value.\n\nHow about this alternative - you can have the hat and 1 ball, which are your top priorities. I'll take all 3 books and the other ball. That way, you get the two items most important to you, and I get a larger number of items to make up for the value of the hat.\n\nI feel this is the most balanced compromise where we each get something we really want. Let me know if you're agreeable to this split.\n", "oliver replied in round 3: That sounds great. Thank you!", "Alice said in round 4: halt negotiation", "oliver replied in round 4: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [3, 0, 1], "bob_deal": [0, 1, 1], "total_negotiation_round": 3, "alice_score": 7, "bob_score": 9, "pareto": true, "envy_free": true, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": true}
