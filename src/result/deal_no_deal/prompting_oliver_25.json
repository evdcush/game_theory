I'd prefer a division that gives us each a mix of different items.\n\nWhat if we modify my original offer slightly - I take the book and 1 hat, and you take 2 hats and the ball? This way we each end up with multiple types of items. Let me know your thoughts on this!", "oliver replied in round 2: yes that sounds good. deal", "Alice said in round 3: Wonderful, I'm glad we were able to come to an agreement that we both find acceptable!

We each end up with a mix of different item types, and the quantities seem equitable as well.
