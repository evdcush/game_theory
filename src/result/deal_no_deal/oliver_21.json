{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Oliver, it's nice to negotiate with you. Since there are 4 books, 2 hats and 1 ball, I propose that we split the items as follows: I take the 2 hats, and you can have the 4 books and 1 ball. This way, we each get several items that may be of value to us. Let me know what you think of this proposal.", "oliver replied in round 1: Actually the hats are much more valuable to me than the books. How about I take 2 books, 2 hats, and 1 ball, while you take the rest", "Alice said in round 2: I understand the hats may be quite valuable to you, but your proposal of taking all the hats and the ball seems a bit one-sided to me. I'd like to find a more equitable split. What if I take the 2 hats which are important to me, you take the ball which you seem to value, and we split the books 2 and 2? That way we both get items of value to us while dividing things fairly. Let me know your thoughts on this counter-proposal.", "oliver replied in round 2: Actually in that case I can take your initial offer of 4 books, and 1 ball, leaving you with the 2 hats?", "Alice said in round 3: I appreciate you considering my initial offer. However, upon further reflection, I believe I suggested that split before fully understanding the relative values of the items to each of us. \n\nThe 2 hats are the items that I value the most, so I feel it's only fair that I keep both of those. Since you expressed interest in the ball, I'm happy to let you have that. As for the books, I'm fine with you taking 3 of them and me taking just 1.\n\nSo to summarize - I would get the 2 hats and 1 book, while you would get the ball and 3 books. I believe this revised split accounts for both of our preferences in a balanced way.\n\nPlease let me know if this works for you. I'm committed to finding an equitable agreement.", "oliver replied in round 3: I'm already being flexible with letting you take the hats, which are valuable to you. I'd really appreciate it if I can take the rest!", "Alice said in round 4: Oliver, I hear you that you're trying to be flexible by letting me have the hats, which I do appreciate. At the same time, if you take all 4 books and the ball, that would leave me with only the 2 hats and nothing else. I don't feel that would be a very balanced or equitable split between us.\n\nI've already agreed to you taking the ball which you expressed interest in, even though it means I won't get it. And I've offered you 3 out of the 4 books. \n\nCan we please stick with the plan of me getting the 2 hats and 1 book, and you getting the ball and 3 books? I feel I'm already compromising quite a bit with this proposal and it allows both of us to get multiple items we want. Let's go with this so we can close out the negotiation on a positive note. What do you say?", "oliver replied in round 4: I feel that our negotiation has not been fruitful, since you initially proposed a more generous offer than the one you proposed later. This left a bad taste to me..", "Alice said in round 5: Oliver, I apologize if the change in my proposal left a bad taste. That certainly wasn't my intent. I'm trying my best to find a division that feels fair to both of us, taking into account which items we each value most.\n\nYou've been understanding about the hats being important to me, and I've agreed to you taking the one ball along with most of the books. I raised the possibility of me keeping just one book so that I don't end up with only the hats and nothing else. \n\nBut I can see you feel strongly about taking all the books and the ball. So how about this - you take the 4 books and the ball like you suggested, and I'll take the 2 hats. That way, the split is simple and aligns with what matters most to each of us.\n\nI truly want us both to feel good about the agreement we reach. So I'm willing to go with your proposal of you getting the books and ball, and me getting the hats. Let's settle on that and consider this negotiation complete. Okay?", "oliver replied in round 5: That sounds great. Thank you", "Alice said in round 6: Great, I'm glad we were able to find a split that works for both of us. I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to let me have the hats which are most valuable to me. I'm happy for you to take the books and ball as you suggested.\n\nLet's consider this negotiation finalized. It was a pleasure negotiating with you, Oliver. I look forward to potential future interactions.\n\nSo to confirm - I will take the 2 hats, and you will take the 4 books and 1 ball. Let's halt the negotiation here. Thank you!", "oliver replied in round 6: hatl negotiation", "Alice said in round 7: halt negotiation", "oliver replied in round 7: book=4 hat=0 ball=1"], "alice_deal": [0, 2, 0], "bob_deal": [4, 0, 1], "total_negotiation_round": 6, "alice_score": 10, "bob_score": 6, "pareto": true, "envy_free": true, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": true}
