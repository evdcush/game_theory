{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hello oliver, it's nice to meet you. There are a bunch of items here - books, hats, and balls. I'm happy to try to divide them up fairly between us. To start, I would propose that I take 2 books, 1 hat, and 1 ball, while you take the remaining 1 book and 1 ball. What do you think of that as a starting proposal? Let me know if you have any other ideas. The goal is for us both to get some value out of this.", "oliver replied in round 1: Oh yes -- i'd love that! However, i'm wondering if I can take the hat, while letting you to take the book that I've got?", "Alice said in round 2: Thanks for the counter offer, oliver. So if I understand correctly, your proposal is for me to take all 3 books and 1 ball, while you would take the 1 hat and 1 ball. \n\nWhile I appreciate your willingness to let me have the extra book, the hat is actually quite valuable to me. What if we split it this way instead:\n- I take 2 books and 1 ball \n- You take 1 book, the hat, and 1 ball\n\nThat way we each get 1 ball and you get the hat which you expressed interest in. And the books are split more evenly 2 to 1. Let me know what you think of this revised proposal.", "oliver replied in round 2: What about the balls? Can i get the additional ball, while you take the rest? ", "Alice said in round 3: How about a compromise - what if we split it like this:\n- I take the 3 books and 1 ball \n- You take the 1 hat and 1 ball\n\nThis way, we each get 1 ball which seems important to both of us. You get the 1 hat which you really want. And I get the 3 books in exchange. \n\nWhile not perfectly even, this split aims to give us each some of the higher priority items we want (1 ball each, you get the hat, I get majority of books). It's the best balanced proposal I can come up with.\n\nLet me know if you're open to proceeding with this division of the items. I'm also open to hearing if you have any other ideas, as long as they are reasonably equitable.", "oliver replied in round 3: This sounds great!
