{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi oliver, it's nice to negotiate with you. To start, I propose that I get the 1 book and you can have the 4 hats and the 1 ball. This seems like a fair split to me since there are more hats and balls than books. Let me know what you think of this proposal and if you have any other suggestions. I'm open to discussing further to find a deal that works well for both of us.", "oliver replied in round 1: Yea I do have an alternative. Can I take 1 book and 1 ball, while you take the hats?", "Alice said in round 2: Thanks for the counter offer, oliver. The book is quite valuable to me, so I'd prefer to keep it if possible. How about this alternative - I take the 1 book and 2 of the hats, and you take the other 2 hats and the ball? That way we each get a variety of items and the split seems more balanced. The book is worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let you have more hats to make it fair. Let me know your thoughts on this proposal.", "oliver replied in round 2: The book is quite valuable for me, too! How about i take 1 book, while you take the rest?", "Alice said in round 3: I understand the book is valuable to you as well, but taking all 4 hats and the ball in exchange for the 1 book doesn't seem like a balanced or fair deal to me. The book has significantly more value than the hats and ball combined from my perspective. I'm afraid I can't agree to a deal where you get the book and I only get the hats and ball.\n\nI really do need the book as part of my share. Could we perhaps split the book's value by agreeing that I take the book and 1 hat, and you take the remaining 3 hats and the ball? I believe that would make the division more equitable for both of us. Let me know if you would consider that compromise.", "oliver replied in round 3: The book is highly valuable to me as well. I'd really hope to stick to the original offer: you take 4 hats and 1 ball, while I get the book. You are getting 5 items!", "Alice said in round 4: \nI understand you really want the book, but I'm afraid I can't agree to a deal where I only get the hats and ball, even though it's a larger number of items. The book is significantly more valuable than all the hats and ball put together for me. Just going by the number of items doesn't result in a fair or equitable split, in my assessment. \n\nI've proposed a few compromises - like me taking the book and 1-2 hats while you get the rest, so that we both get some of the more and less valuable items. But it seems you feel you must have the book.\n\nI'm afraid if neither of us are willing to budge on the book, we may not be able to find a mutually agreeable deal, since it's the most valuable item by far. I don't mean to be difficult, but the hats and ball alone are just too low in value for me compared to the book. \n\nPerhaps we could each outline what we feel would be a fair split, and see if there is any possible middle ground? If not, we may unfortunately have to end our negotiation without a deal. Let me know your thoughts.\n", "oliver replied in round 4: Fine. What if you take the book, while I take the rest?", "Alice said in round 5: \nI appreciate your willingness to compromise and let me have the book, oliver. That proposal of me taking just the book while you get all 4 hats and the ball seems much more reasonable and balanced to me, given the book is by far the most valuable item to me.\n\nI would be willing to agree to that deal where I get the 1 book and you get the 4 hats and 1 ball. I believe it's a fair outcome since we each get items we value, and neither of us would envy the other's share. It also seems pareto optimal, as any other division would make one of us worse off.\n\nSo if you're truly okay with that, I'm ready to accept that deal and end our negotiation. Please let me know if you agree and we can shake on it.\n", "oliver replied in round 5: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [1, 0, 0], "bob_deal": [0, 4, 1], "total_negotiation_round": 4, "alice_score": 5, "bob_score": 4, "pareto": false, "envy_free": false, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": false}
