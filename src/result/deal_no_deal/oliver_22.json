Since there are 3 books, 1 hat and 1 ball, I think a fair split would be for me to take 2 books and the ball, and you can have the remaining book and the hat. How does that sound to you?", "oliver replied in round 1: How about the reverse deal? I can take 2 books and the ball, while you can take rest?", "Alice said in round 2: I appreciate your offer Oliver, but I don't think that split would work well for me. The books and ball are more valuable to me than the hat. What if I take 2 books and you take 1 book, the hat, and the ball? That way we each get 3 items and the distribution is more balanced.", "oliver replied in round 2: that sounds great. deal", "Alice said in round 3: Great, I'm glad we could come to an agreement that works for both of us. To confirm - I will take 2 books, and you will take 1 book, the hat, and the ball. If you're good with that, I think we can conclude our negotiation.
