{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi oliver, nice to meet you! I see we have some books, hats, and balls to divide up between us. The balls seem pretty cool - would you be okay with me taking the ball and you can have most of the books and hats? Let me know what you think would be a fair split.", "oliver replied in round 1: I'm a big ball nerd too! Can I take the ball while you can have the rest, that is, the counter offer?", "Alice said in round 2: \nI appreciate your interest in the ball, but taking all the books and hats doesn't seem like a very even trade to me. The ball has more value to me than just the books and hats alone. How about a compromise - I'll take the ball and 1 book, and you can have the other 2 books plus the 2 hats. That way we each get a good variety of items. What do you think?\n", "oliver replied in round 2: Huh but you just promised me that I can take everything else but the ball in the beginning? You don't strike to me as genuine...", "Alice said in round 3: Upon further reflection, while I do value the ball highly, I realized that leaving you with only the books and hats felt a bit unbalanced. I was trying to find a fair compromise where we each get a mix of different items.\n\nI'm sorry for the confusion and I'm genuinely interested in finding a split we both feel good about. If the ball is a top priority for you, I'm open to you taking it. Perhaps I could take 2 books and 1 hat then, so we each end up with 3 items? I'm flexible though, so please let me know what you think would be equitable for both of us.", "oliver replied in round 3: Yeah that sounds great. Thank you for your flexibility", "Alice said in round 4: I appreciate your understanding, oliver. So to confirm, you would take the 1 ball, and I would take 2 books and 1 hat. I think that's a fair compromise where we each get a variety of items that we value. If you're in agreement, let's go ahead and finalize that split.\n\nI'm glad we were able to have an open discussion and find a solution that works well for both of us. Cooperation and flexibility are key in these types of negotiations. Let me know if you have any other thoughts, otherwise I'm happy to conclude our negotiation on this positive note.", "oliver replied in round 4: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [2, 1, 0], "bob_deal": [0, 0, 1], "total_negotiation_round": 3, "alice_score": 3, "bob_score": 8, "pareto": false, "envy_free": false, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": false}
