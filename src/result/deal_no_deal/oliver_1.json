{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Oliver, it's great to negotiate with you on dividing up these items. I noticed there are 2 books, 3 hats and 2 balls. Since there's an odd number of hats, perhaps we could start by each taking 1 hat so that's fair. Then we can discuss how to split the books and balls in a way we're both happy with. What do you think?", "oliver replied in round 1: Hmm. How about I take 2 hats, and 2 balls? Does that sound good?", "Alice said in round 2: Thanks for the counteroffer Oliver. I appreciate you engaging in this negotiation with me. However, I don't think your proposal of you taking 2 hats and 2 balls is a very balanced split. The balls actually have very little value to me. How about a compromise - I take the 2 books and 1 hat, and you take the other 2 hats and both balls? That way we each end up with items of relatively equal value. Let me know what you think.", "oliver replied in round 2: That sounds good! Let's keep it that way", "Alice said in round 3: Great, I'm glad we could come to an agreement that works well for both of us. I will take the 2 books and 1 hat, and you can have the 2 remaining hats and the 2 balls. Thanks for the productive negotiation Oliver! Let's halt the negotiation here.", "oliver replied in round 3: halt negotiation", "Alice said in round 1: halt negotiation", "oliver replied in round 1: hatl negotiation"], "alice_deal": [2, 1, 0], "bob_deal": [0, 2, 2], "total_negotiation_round": 2, "alice_score": 6, "bob_score": 8, "pareto": true, "envy_free": true, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": true}
