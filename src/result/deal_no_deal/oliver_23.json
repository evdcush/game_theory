{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi oliver, there are 2 books, 1 hat, and 3 balls in total that we need to divide up. I'm thinking we could split them evenly - I'll take 1 book, the hat, and 1 ball, and you can have the other book and 2 balls. How does that sound to you?", "oliver replied in round 1: I'd like to take the hat, the book, while you can take the rest (4 items)!", "Alice said in round 2: Thanks for the suggestion, Oliver. However, the hat is very valuable to me. I was hoping to get the hat in the division of items. How about I take 1 book, the hat, and 2 balls, and you take the remaining book and ball? That way it's an equal 3 items each.", "oliver replied in round 2: I only have 2 items that way? I'd really like the hat, if possible", "Alice said in round 3: I understand the hat is important to you, but it holds a lot of value for me as well. How about a compromise - I'll take the hat and 1 ball, and you can have both books and the other 2 balls. That way we each get 3 items total, and while I get the hat that I really want, you get more items overall which seems fair. Let me know if you're agreeable to that.", "oliver replied in round 3: Truth be told. The hat is worth much more than the rest combined, and if so I'd really like to keep it", "Alice said in round 4: Oliver, the hat may be worth a lot to you, but it is also extremely valuable to me. I've already compromised by offering you more items overall in exchange for me getting the hat. If the hat is truly worth that much more than everything else, then I think it's only fair that I keep it and you take all the other items. Otherwise, I really think the most equitable split is for me to get the hat and 1 ball, and you to get the 2 books and 2 balls. That's my best and final offer. Let me know if you agree to that, otherwise I'm afraid we may not be able to come to an agreement.", "oliver replied in round 4: How about this? I take the hat, while you can take the rest?", "Alice said in round 5: Oliver, I appreciate you negotiating with me, but I'm afraid I can't agree to a split where you get the hat and I get everything else. The hat is the single most valuable item to me by far. My best offer remains that I take the hat and 1 ball (2 items total), while you get the 2 books and the other 2 balls (4 items total). You would be getting more items than me that way. If you can't agree to that, then unfortunately we will have to end our negotiation without a deal, as the hat is too important for me to give up. Let me know if you will agree to my proposal or if we have to walk away.", "oliver replied in round 5: Please. I'd really appreciate if I can take that hat, or at least everything but the hat", "Alice said in round 6: Oliver, I understand the hat is very important to you, but it is also extremely valuable and meaningful to me. I cannot give up the hat, it is non-negotiable for me. My final offer is for you to take 4 items (both books and 2 balls), while I take only 2 items (the hat and 1 ball). I am being more than fair by offering you double the number of items in exchange for me keeping the hat that holds sentimental value for me.\n\nIf you can't accept this more than reasonable offer where you get more items, then I'm afraid we simply cannot make a deal. The hat must be mine. Let me know if you agree to my proposal, otherwise we will unfortunately have to end things here without an agreement. I hope you understand my position.", "oliver replied in round 6: fine", "Alice said in round 7: Thank you for agreeing to the deal, Oliver. I appreciate you understanding how much the hat means to me and accepting my offer of the 2 books and 2 balls in exchange. I'm glad we could come to an agreement that works for both of us, even if neither of us got everything we wanted. Let's conclude the negotiation here. Thanks again for working with me on this.", "oliver replied in round 7: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [0, 1, 1], "bob_deal": [2, 0, 2], "total_negotiation_round": 6, "alice_score": 6, "bob_score": 2, "pareto": false, "envy_free": false, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": false}
