Since we want this to be a fair split, how about I take the hat and 1 ball, and you can have the book and the other 2 balls? That way we each get a variety of items. Let me know what you think.", "oliver replied in round 1: Hey thanks for the offer. I'd be happy to let you take all the balls, while I get to keep the book and the hat. That sounds good?", "Alice said in round 2: Thanks for the counteroffer oliver. While I appreciate you offering me all the balls, the hat is actually the item I value the most. How about a compromise - I take the hat and 1 ball, and you get the book and the other 2 balls? That way we both get items we prefer. What do you think?", "oliver replied in round 2: That sounds good", "Alice said in round 3: Great, I'm glad we could come to an agreement that works for both of us. To confirm, I will take the hat and 1 ball, and you will take the book and the other 2 balls. If you're good with that, let's halt the negotiation so we can collect our items.
