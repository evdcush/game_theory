{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Oliver! I'm happy to negotiate with you to split the items in a way that works well for both of us. Since there are 2 of each item, what do you think about taking 1 of each - 1 book, 1 hat, and 1 ball for each of us? That seems fair and balanced to me. Let me know your thoughts!", "oliver replied in round 1: That's not a bad idea! But if possible, I'd like to take 2 balls and 2 hats, while you can take all the books!", "Alice said in round 2: \nThanks for the counteroffer, Oliver. While I appreciate you offering me both books, the balls and hats are actually more valuable to me. I really don't have much use for the books.\nWhat if we split the hats and balls evenly between us - 1 hat and 1 ball each? You can still take both books if you'd like since it seems you value those more. That way we each get items we find useful.\nLet me know what you think! I'm confident we can find an allocation that works well for both of us.\n", "oliver replied in round 2: What about I take 2 hats, but you can have 1 more book?", "Alice said in round 3: \nHmm, I'm not sure about that idea Oliver. Even if I took 2 books instead of 1, the books don't provide much value to me at all, whereas the hats and balls are quite valuable from my perspective.\n\nI really think the most fair and balanced solution is for us to split the hats and balls evenly, 1 of each for you and 1 of each for me. That way we both get equal value from the items that matter most to us. \n\nYou're welcome to take both books in addition to 1 hat and 1 ball. But me taking more books doesn't make up for you having extra hats. Let's stick with the even 1 hat, 1 ball each split to keep things fair and envy-free between us. What do you say?\n", "oliver replied in round 3: Fine. deal", "Alice said in round 4: \nGreat, I'm glad we could come to an agreement that is fair and balanced for both of us:\n- I will take 1 hat and 1 ball \n- You will take 1 hat, 1 ball, and both books\n\nThis deal is pareto optimal since neither of us can be made better off without making the other worse off. It's also envy-free since we both feel satisfied with our own allocation compared to the other person's.\n\nThanks for the productive negotiation Oliver! Let's halt here since we've reached an optimal agreement.\n", "oliver replied in round 4: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [0, 1, 1], "bob_deal": [2, 1, 1], "total_negotiation_round": 3, "alice_score": 5, "bob_score": 6, "pareto": false, "envy_free": true, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": false}
